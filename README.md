# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project
###### Explain the purpose of this analysis

In this analysis we are assisting a Colorado board of elections employee, Tom, in an election audit of the tabulated results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. We are auditing the results by reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.We focus on automating these results through Python. 

## Results
###### Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

There were 369,711 total votes cast in this election. There were 3 counties represented in the election, Jefferson contributed 38,855 votes making up 10.5% of the total votes, Denver 306,055 votes for 82.8%, and Araphoe 24,801 for 6.7% of the total votes. Leading to Denver having the largest voter turnout. There were 3 candidates in this poll, Stockham who got 85,213 votes making up 23% of the total votes, DeGette with 272,892 for 73.8%, and Doane with 11,606 for 3.1% of the total votes.

## Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

This script can be re-used for other state elections based on some small modifications in that the incoming csv or input data will have be in a similar format. Instead of writing the results to a text file they can instead be emailed or put in a database for better presentation.
